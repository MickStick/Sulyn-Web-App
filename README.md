## The Web Application

This web application is made with a **Node JS** and **Express** server-side/back-end. The back-end utilizes simple server-client requests and responses. It also utilizes a file system for storing reservation data.

The front-end is made with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript** and **JQuery**. **HTML5** and **CSS3** for the UI design while the **Javascript**/**JQuery** is used for server-client communication. The web app responsiveness is also taken cared of by using plain out Vanilla **Javascript**.
